BIT RACER: VR
=============
![](https://github.com/drfuzzyness/BitRacerVR/blob/master/Marketing/menu.gif?raw=true)

A procedurally generated obstacle course for Google Cardboard. Glide through the procedurally generated tunnel at an increasingly breakneck pace, collect coins, dodge mines, and get through the gate at the end of the level.

Put on your **Google Cardboard** and download the **latest build for Android from** [GitHub](https://github.com/drfuzzyness/BitRacerVR/releases).

## What I did
- Player controller adjusts to player looking around in Cardboard
- Runtime level generation
- Game elements: score, lives, game-over, menus, animations
- (simplistic) 3D Models
- Balances the difficulty over time to teach the player the different obstacles
- Visual design
